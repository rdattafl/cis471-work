Draw a detailed schematic (by hand or computerized) of your hardware design for the [gp4 CLA module](https://github.com/cis571/lc4-labs/blob/master/lab2b-alu/lab2-cla.md) and [the ALU as a whole](https://github.com/cis571/lc4-labs/blob/master/lab2b-alu/lab2-alu.md). You don't need to draw a CLA schematic; the schematic in the lecture slides is pretty detailed already.

You should include signal names, module names, port names and bus widths. You can leave a module as a black box to simplify things, but then you should show elsewhere on the schematic what that black box does. Simple modules (muxes, shifters, registers, incrementers) can be drawn as in the lecture slides and don't need further elaboration.

See also [the example schematic for Lab 1](https://github.com/cis571/lc4-labs/blob/master/lab1/lab1-schematic.pdf).

When your schematic is complete, you can translate it directly into Verilog.

We encourage you to keep your schematic up-to-date as your design evolves.
